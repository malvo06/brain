### Week 8
Set up the flask app for the demo.

### Week 7
Ran tests on different class weights to match the biases in the dataset.

### Week 5
Ran test with Xception instead of VGG-16 and different contrast sharpening method + VGG16.

Image preprocessing by observing the histogram. Used skikit to rescale intensity for defined features.
Resulting images had some feature definition but still remained fuzzy

### Week 1
Basic observations on the dataset
